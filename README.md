Of course, this project is a service and a message of thanks and gratitude to the company I was training with, and I asked them to present this project to them because it is in line with their goals, and thank God it received everyone’s acceptance and satisfaction 🙏🏻❤️

The project took me a lot of effort in terms of pulling and cleaning the #data so that I could use it in a way that suits the ideas I would like to present.

I tried to summarize the following ideas:

First, in this guide, I collected more than 10 types of food and grouped #restaurants (Lebanese, Moroccan, Egyptian, etc...) under the name Arab Restaurants.

Secondly, the guide covers the four regions of #Riyadh: the north, south, east, and west

Thirdly, I tried to provide the most important types of services, the number of reviews, and the rating rate

The goal of the number of #reviews is to know the most popular restaurants, even if they are on par with other restaurants

Suggestions and insights:

#Investor
You are looking for an opportunity to open a restaurant in northern Riyadh, which is considered a very difficult place to start because the competition there is strong
In Riyadh in general, the competition has become high quality, even with the diversity of #varieties

But you can look at eastern Riyadh and understand that the competition is less intense, taking into account the area, its population, and the types of restaurants available🗺️

The existing restaurants are mostly Arab restaurants and are distinguished in their field. Still, European and Asian restaurants are few compared to the rest and their quality is also not comparable to the rest.
You can excel in this field and have a chance, as there is competition even in terms of the diversity of services, delivery to the car, and a few restaurants that you can solve. They may adopt the idea and succeed with you💯


There is also a great idea, which is seafood🍤

Their number is tiny compared to the number of other restaurants in Riyadh, but we take into account the nature of the social situation. They may not prefer it due to its lack of availability, but you can choose a location like Al-Shamal that brings together all social backgrounds for you and you will have a greater opportunity.


Social media channels

It plays a major role in determining the restaurant’s popularity and demand in terms of reminding customers to evaluate the restaurant, and this is a cornerstone of interacting with advertisements on a large scale.

And that's how we finished

I was pleased and honored to serve you ❤️

In conclusion:

- It was based on showing the most-rated restaurants

-Comparison between types of services
- Comparison of the number of reviews
- Comparison of restaurant types
- Comparison of the most-rated restaurants in each category
